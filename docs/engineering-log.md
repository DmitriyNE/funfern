# Engineering log

Low-effort working notes: what changed, what was checked, TODOs, open issues, and
next steps. Short bullets are enough; no entry is required for every tiny edit.
Keep current actions near the top and dated entries newest first. Durable decisions
belong in [architecture.md](architecture.md) and milestone scope in [plan.md](plan.md).

## Current TODOs

- [ ] Connect a browser and complete [browser-checks.md](browser-checks.md), including
  upload/download, visual QA, unsupported-WebGPU messaging, and frame-time observations.
- [ ] Record browser version, GPU/backend, display scale, and performance for the
  supplied eight-obstacle scene. Do not treat the headless tests as browser QA.
- [ ] Milestone 2: robust meshing predicates and constrained triangular meshing.

## 2026-09-09 — Milestone 1 implementation and verification

- Added the Bevy 0.19.1 / bevy_egui 0.42.0 application, explicit rendering/window/
  input/WebGPU features, full-window canvas, startup diagnostics, and Trunk setup.
  Bevy owns the only wgpu device. Active dependencies exclude audio, PBR/3D
  rendering, and WebGL fallback; `femfun-core` still has no dependencies.
- Implemented nonuniform periodic cubic de Boor evaluation and two derivatives,
  shape-preserving seam insertion, reshaping removal, and adaptive hull sampling.
- Implemented preset/custom creation, hit testing, coordinate editing, curve and
  control overlays, panning/zoom/Fit View, disabled simulation controls, and
  persistent invalid drafts with accepted references and structured diagnostics.
- Added incremental validation with per-frame and total work ceilings. Bounding
  boxes skip disjoint loops. A 32-loop scene completes within 128 slices of
  12,000 operations; this is a deterministic work check, not a frame-time claim.
- Added 100-entry snapshot history, Escape rollback, Revert Draft, monotonic IDs,
  versioned JSON, browser/native file-dialog paths, and atomic validated loads.
  Serde's float-roundtrip feature is required to keep exact f64 values on reload.
- Regression fixes: near-seam insertion must not create false self-contact from
  tiny adjacent sample spans; existing curve knots snap in screen space; plain
  handle selection must not create a history entry; custom previews use the
  actual committed control points; finite extreme drafts remain loadable.
- Verification: formatting, Clippy with `-D warnings`, and all **26 tests** pass
  (10 core, 9 document/persistence, 7 real egui input tests). Coverage includes
  repeated seam insertion/derivatives, affine/uniform agreement, geometry guards,
  validation limits and revisions, both creation workflows, handle dragging,
  Escape, one-entry history, numeric edits, typing capture, panel scrolling,
  insertion/removal, cursor zoom, both pan gestures, and viewport resize.
- `cargo build -p femfun-app --locked` passes. `cargo run -p femfun-app --locked`
  starts a native window and initializes **Apple M1 Max / Metal**. bevy_egui
  reports its known Metal bindless-texture fallback; no startup failure observed.
- `NO_COLOR=true trunk build --release` passes with Rust 1.96.0 and Trunk 0.21.14.
  Trunk fetched wasm-bindgen 0.2.128 and wasm-opt 123. Browser bundle is about
  **24 MiB WASM + 112 KiB JS**, uncompressed. `trunk serve --release` builds,
  watches/rebuilds, and serves at localhost:8080; an HTTP probe returns 200.
  The sandbox required permission for helper-cache writes and local serving.
- **Browser verification remains incomplete:** browser connection discovery
  returned no available browsers. No browser version, browser GPU, visual QA,
  upload/download result, unsupported-WebGPU runtime result, or browser frame-time
  measurement is claimed. The browser checklist and eight-obstacle JSON fixture
  are ready. Native file-dialog interaction is also unexercised; JSON logic is tested.
- Updated README, architecture, and milestone notes. Meshing, wave evolution,
  and solver transaction machinery remain deferred.

## Open issues and experiments

- Performance budgets need measurements on an actual browser/GPU; no fixed mesh
  capacity or realtime throughput is promised yet.
- Custom predicate robustness and handling of nearly touching geometry need focused
  design and tests in the mesher milestone.
- Newly exposed region initialization and time-staggered state transfer need concrete
  policies before live geometry commits.
- Select the higher-order boundary radiation formulation and corner treatment during
  the absorber milestone.
- IGA mass treatment and explicit timestep behavior are research tasks for the
  single-patch implementation.

## 2026-09-09 — Project setup and agreed direction

- Added milestone 0 for repository setup, documentation, and project initialization.
- Initialized a Rust workspace with an empty, dependency-free `femfun-core` library.
  The application and its dependencies start in milestone 1.
- Wrote the README, milestone plan, and architecture notes.
- Adopted egui for panels and this file for lightweight development notes.
- Recorded the main choices: custom math, triangles before IGA, boundary-only
  radiation, bounded adaptation, and transactional geometry/parameter edits.
- Preparation may span frames while the old system evolves. Build the transfer map
  against that system, then transfer its latest state at commit time.
- Energy drift during edits is acceptable. Physical moving-wall effects are deferred.
- Verification: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo check --workspace --locked`,
  and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings` pass with
  Rust 1.96.0. Generated the lockfile offline. No numerical tests exist yet because
  the core contains no implementation; browser execution starts in milestone 1.
- Next: begin the browser shell and spline editor after this setup step.
